Key Concepts
============
* Produce initial "binned" dataframes that we then combine and manipulate to produce analysis results.
* "Back-end" of the code in this step uses AlphaTwirl.
* Two executables of interest: ``nanoaod2dataframes_cfg`` and ``trees2dataframes_cfg`` (these might be renamed and merged in future).
* Each one receives a config file to define how many binned dataframes are made, how they are binned, and what event selection should be applied (if any).
